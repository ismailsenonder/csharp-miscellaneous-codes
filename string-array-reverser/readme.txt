This method reverses the elements of a string array and the strings themselves. For example:

input: {"Fred","George","Ron","Ginny"}
output: {"ynniG","noR","egroeG","derF"}

Additionally, an optional parameter is added.
If it's set to true, the method also changes the uppercase-lowercase status of the chars in the string. Example:

input: {"HellO","WoRLd","iSmAiL","SENonder"}
output: {"REDNOnes","lIaMsI","DlrOw","oLLEh"}
